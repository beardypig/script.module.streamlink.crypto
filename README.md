script.module.streamlink.crypto
===============================

Kodi addon that provides the cryptographic functions required by streamlink.

Provides part of the `PyCrpyto(dome)` API to allow `streamlink` to use the
cryptographic functions it needs.

This is based on the three pure Python cryptographic libraries:
 * [CryptoPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptopy)
 * [rsa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rsa)
 * Michael Gilfix's Blowfish implementation
